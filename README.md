This a customer-facing website where users can get detailed information about the hotel, browse all cabins, reserve a cabin, and create and update their profile. This web app is completely built using NEXT-JS which is a framework built on top of react JS. To add styling in this app I used tailwind css. In order to store the data and perform backend operations, I used the Supabase platform, which provides backend services. UI state management is done with the help of context API.
